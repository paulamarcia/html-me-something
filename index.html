					<h2>NYC</h2>
					<p>My partner and I like to travel to NYC every year for their Pride activities in June. We've attended parades that have lasted 6hrs. We've seen celebrities from all over.</p>

					<p>Atlanta is a great city to celebrate anything but it is particularly exciting to participate in Black Pride events typically held around Labor Day weekend every year.</p>
